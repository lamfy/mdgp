# New Integer Linear Programming Formulations for the Maximally Diverse Grouping Problem

The Maximally Diverse Grouping Problem (MDGP) is the problem
of assigning a set of elements to mutually disjoint groups in order to maximise
the overall diversity between the elements. The MDGP is often formulated as
an Integer Quadratic Programme (IQP). Because the MDGP is NP-complete,
most studies have focused on heuristic solution approaches, as compared to
exact solution approaches, to the problem. Although heuristic solution ap-
proaches are often used in practice, these approaches do not guarantee a global
optimal solution. Conversely, although exact solution approaches are not of-
ten used in practice, these approaches guarantee a global optimal solution,
and therefore serve as useful benchmarks for the performance of heuristics.
As such, a few studies have reformulated the MDGP as an Integer Linear
Programme (ILP), which can be solved using exact solution approaches. The
present paper proposes two new ILP formulations, and compares their perfor-
mances against existing formulations. The proposed formulations can be used
to establish useful benchmarks for the performance of heuristics in a broader
range of applications moving forward.
